                    <h2>What is Typescript. Short story</h2>
                    <h3>What is Typescript?</h3>
                    <p>
                        TypeScript is an extended version of JavaScript with the main purpose of making it easier to develop large JS applications.
                    </p>
                        TypeScript is a JavaScript extension that gives the user the ability to work with static typing and robust tooling. Using it 
                        will avoid many of the annoying bugs that JavaScript developers often encounter. TypeScript reports errors even before 
                        you save the file and allows you to write code much faster. This gives the developer time to think and test the really
                        important things. This language adds many new principles - classes, generics, interfaces, static types.
                    <p>
                        TypeScript code is compiled into JS and is suitable for developing any projects for any browsers - especially since you 
                        can choose the JS version into which the code will be compiled.
                        TypeScript is an open source project, so it is developing very quickly. Much that appears in TS will later migrate to JavaScript:
                        let and const, arrow functions, and so on, for example.
                    </p>

                        <h3>Short story</h3>
                    <p>
                        TypeScript arose out of supposed JavaScript flaws in large-scale applications at both Microsoft and other JavaScript users.
                        Problems with the development of complex programs in JavaScript led to the need to facilitate the development of language components.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The TypeScript developers were looking for a solution that would not break compatibility with the standard and its
                        cross-platform support.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                        1. TypeScript code is converted to Plain JavaScript. <br>
                        TypeScript code is not understandable to browsers. This is why, if the code is written in TypeScript,
                        then it compiles and transforms the code, i.e. translates the code to JavaScript. 
                        The above process is called Trans-piled. With JavaScript code, browsers can read the code and display.
                        </p>  
                        <p class="fragment">
                            2. JavaScript is TypeScript - any code written in JavaScript can be converted to TypeScript 
                            by changing the extension from .js to .ts.
                        </p>  
                        <p class="fragment">
                            3. Use TypeScript anywhere: TypeScript code can run in any browser, on any device, or on any operating system.
                            TypeScipt is not specific to any virtual machine, etc.
                        </p>  
                        <p class="fragment">
                            4. TypeScript supports JS libraries: With TypeScript, developers can use existing JavaScript code,
                            include popular JavaScript libraries, and can be called from other JavaScript code.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Differences from Javascript</h2>
                        <p>1. Typescript is known as an object oriented programming language whereas JavaScript is a scripting language.</p>
                        <p class="fragment">2. TypeScript has a feature known as static typing, but JavaScript doesn't.</p>
                        <p class="fragment">3. TypeScript supports modules, while JavaScript does not support modules.</p>
                        <p class="fragment">4. TypeScript has an interface, but JavaScript has no interface.</p>

                    <h2>Pros of using Typescript</h2>
                    <p>
                        1. TypeScript always indicates compilation errors only at design time. This makes it much less likely to get errors at run time,
                        whereas JavaScript is an interpreted language.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        2. TypeScript has a feature that is strongly typed or statically typed. This means that static typing allows compile-time 
                        type validation. This is not available in JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        3. The presence of all the new features in JS that you have heard about, but cannot yet use due to poor browser support.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        4. Angular is written in it, and if you want to take full advantage of this framework, then you want to use TypeScript.
                    </p>

                        <h2>When should you use TypeScript?</h2>
                        <p>
                            1. In the case of a large application. TypeScript is great if your application has a large architecture and a lot of code,
                            and especially if there are several developers working on this application.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. In case you and your team are familiar with statically typed programming languages. The team should look towards
                            TypeScript when they want to develop an application in JavaScript and are already familiar with Java or C #, which are
                            statically typed languages.

                    <h2>Data types in Typescript</h2>
                    <p>
                        TypeScript provides the following base types:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Number</li>
                        <li>String</li>
                        <li>Boolean: boolean true or false</li>
                        <li>Null Ð¸ undefined</li>
                        <li>Array</li>
                        <li>Tuple</li>
                        <li>Any: arbitrary type</li>
                        <li>Void: no specific value, used primarily as the return type of functions</li>
                        <li>Never: also represents no value and is used as the return type of functions that generate or return an error</li>
                        <li>Enum: enumeration</li>                             
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Creation and behavior of primitive data types</h2>
                    <p>Let's take a look at the syntax of the language while working with its main feature - strong data typing.</p>
                    <h3>Assigning types</h3>
                    <p>The main way to assign a type to a variable is to write it after the name of the variable using the symbol :</p>
                    <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
let num: number = 42; //decimal numbers
let num: number = 0.222; //floating point numbers
let hex: number = 0xbeef; //hexadecimal numbers
let bin: number = 0b0010; //binary numbers
                    </code></pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>Like other languages, TypeScript uses the String type to store text information:</p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
let str: string = 'Hello World!';              
let multiStr: string = `Two-line
variable`;
let expression = 'New expression';
let expressionStr: string = `Expression 
str: ${ expression }`;
                        </code></pre>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>Where without one of the main data types:</p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                            let boolFalse: boolean = false;
                            let boolTrue: boolean = true;
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>And here we can see assigning of null and undefined:</p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                            let nothing: null = null;
                            let boolTrue: boolean = true;
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            But in fact, we can assign undefined and null values to variables of other types, for example, number:
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                            let x: number = undefined;
                            x = null;
                            x = 5;
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>In this regard, null and undefined act as subtypes of other types and are useful mainly in some operations where the result 
                        is unknown - whether it will be a number or a string, or it will be null. In this case, to avoid a possible error,
                         we can check the value for undefined or null, just like in javascript.
                        </p>
                        <p>This  of assigning is valid for all data types.</p>
                    </section> 
                    <section>
                        <h2>Assigning of arrays</h2>
                        <p>
                            Arrays are defined using the [] expression and are also strongly typed. That is, if the array initially contains strings, 
                            then in the future it will only be able to work with strings.
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                            let list: number[] = [10, 20, 30];
                            let colors: string[] = ["red", "green", "blue"];
                            console.log(list[0]);
                            console.log(colors[1]);
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            As in JavaScript, you can use indexes to access array elements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An alternative way to define arrays is to use the Array <> type:
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
let names:Array<string>=["Tom", "Bob", "Alice"];
console.log(names[1]);  // Bob
                        </code></pre>

                        <h2>Tuples assigning</h2>
                        <p>
                            Tuples, like arrays, represent a set of elements for which the type is already known in advance. For instance:
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
// tuple definition - a tuple consists of
 two elements - a string and a number
let userInfo: [string, number];
// initialize the tuple
userInfo = ["Tom", 28];
// Incorrect initialization - passed values 
do not match types by position
// userInfo = [28, "Tom"]; // Mistake
    
// using a tuple
console.log (userInfo [1]); // 28
userInfo [1] = 37;
                        </code></pre>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Enum assigning</h2>
                        <p>
                            The enum type is designed to describe a set of numeric data using string constants. 
                            So, let's declare the following enumeration:
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                            enum Season { Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn };
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            The enumeration is called Season and has four elements. Now we use enumeration:
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
enum Season { Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn };
let current: Season = Season.Summer;
console.log(current);
current = Season.Autumn; // change of value
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            This creates a variable called current, which is of type Season. In this case, the console will display the number 2. 
                            Since all enumeration elements represent numeric values. The defaults are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
enum Season {Winter=0,Spring=1,Summer=2,Autumn=3};
                        </code></pre>

                        <p>In addition to simple variables, just like in javascript, you can create complex objects. For instance:</p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
let person = {name:"Tom", age:23};
console.log(person.name);
// alternative way to get a property
console.log(person["name"]);
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            But despite the fact that this is actually the same object that we could use in JavaScript, due to the strict typing of TS,
                            we have limitations in this case. In particular, if we have the following code:
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
let person = { name: "Tom", age: 23 };
person = { name: "Alice" };
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Then we get an error on the second line, because the compiler after the first line assumes that the person object will
                            have two properties name and age. There must be correspondence in names, quantity and type of properties.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Any assigning</h2>
                    <p>
                        Any describes data, the type of which may not be known at the time of writing the application.
                    </p>
                    <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
let someVar: any = "hello";
console.log(someVar); // now someVar is string
someVar = 20; 
console.log(someVar);// now someVar - is number
                    </code></pre>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Void assigning</h2>
                        <p>Typically this type is used to prohibit returning a value from a function. To be precise, it tells the compiler that there 
                            shouldn't be any type here. A good example would be a function that prints something to console.log:</p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
function warn(message: string): void {
    console.warn(message);
}
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            But many people forget that by default TypeScript considers null and undefined as subtypes, so void does not prevent
                            functions from returning them. However, you can ask the compiler to treat these subtypes as separate types. 
                            In this case, void will prevent null from being returned, but not undefined. The example below does not throw
                            a compilation error:
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                            function pitfall(): void {
                                return;
                            }
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            You can also use this type when declaring variables, but in this case they will not do you any good, 
                            because you can only write null and undefined in them, but only if they are subtypes.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Never assigning</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Never type indicates that a function can under no circumstances return anything from itself, for example, 
                            it always throws an error or includes an infinite loop that cannot return anything from the function. 
                            This type is a subtype and can be assigned to any type, but not vice versa.
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                            function fail(message: string): never {
                                throw new Error(message);
                            }
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            It's important to understand the difference between never and void here, because it can be confusing at first.
                            A function that returns nothing is void, but as we saw above, it can return undefined. 
                            A function that never returns anything is never; you can think of never as a way of not using the return keyword in 
                            a function.

                        <h2>Alias</h2>
                        <p>
                            TypeScript has the ability to create your own types, called aliases. A custom type is created using the type keyword.
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
type Human = {firstName:string,age:number,height:number}
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            The example above creates a custom Human type containing 3 different properties. An example of creating an object of type Human:
                        </p>
                        <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
const human:Human = {firstName:'Franz',age:32,height:185}
                        </code></pre>

                    <h2>Variable multitype</h2>
                    <p>A variable can be assigned several types by listing them using the | operator</p>
                    <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                        let multitypeVar: string | number = 'String';
                        multitypeVar = 20;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                    In the code above, the variable is assigned two types: string and numeric.
                    Now you can assign both text data and numeric data to a variable.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this presentation, I tried to tell you what TypeScript is, to solve what problems it was created to solve,
                        and examined the basic syntax for defining data types. However, you may wonder if there is a legitimate need for TypeScript,
                        because dynamic typing is always more attractive than static typing. That is why I will leave here a list of articles 
                        that will allow you to look at TypeScript from a different angle.
